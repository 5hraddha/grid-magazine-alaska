# Project: CSS Grid Magazine
This is a simple responsive magazine page on exploring **Alaska**. This page has been made using CSS Grid.

## Technologies and Standards Used
The technologies that have been used are:
  1. HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)
  2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

**There are various tools that have been used throughout the project design and development:**
| Tools                                             | Usage                                             |
|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|

**The main concepts that have been emphasized are:**
1. *Responsive Web Design*
  - The website has been developed following the desktop first approach.
  - The website is designed to smoothly scale on:
      - 1280px and higher (standard laptops and beyond).
      - From 1024px to 1280px (from a tablet in landscape to a standard laptop).
      - From 768px to 1024px (from a tablet in portrait to a tablet in landscape).
      - From 425px to 768px (from a large smartphone to a tablet in portrait).
      - Up to 425px (mobile devices).  
2. [CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)
3. [CSS Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)
4. *Optimising Fonts for Devices with Different Resolutions*
  - Text Smoothing
  - Kerning
  - Text Rendering

The website is using [BEM — Block Element Modifier](https://en.bem.info/methodology/quick-start/) methodology to create reusable and understandable components in CSS. The idea behind it is to divide the user interface into independent blocks. This makes interface development easy and fast and it allows reuse of existing code without copying and pasting. We are also using [Nested BEM File structure organization](https://en.bem.info/methodology/filestructure/#nested) for CSS.
